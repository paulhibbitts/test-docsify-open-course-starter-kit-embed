3. You will now be able to edit your Docsify site (in the `docs` folder) using the desktop editor of your choice (e.g. atom.io)
4. Use GitHub Desktop to push any changes to your repository. [Learn more about using GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project).

You can also clone (i.e download) a copy of your repository to your computer and [run Docsify locally](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) to preview your site. See the below video for details.
